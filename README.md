# Student Code Questions

Students should include code when asking questions, to provide context and a
medium for specific answers. In a typical workflow, answering such questions
can be challenging, especially when I want to point to multiple lines of code.

GitHub's comment feature is an efficient means of writing about particular
aspects of a program. It's a perfect fit for commenting on student code.
